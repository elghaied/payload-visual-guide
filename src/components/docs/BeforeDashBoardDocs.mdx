### Before Dashboard

The `BeforeDashboard` component renders the 'welcome' block that you see after logging into your admin panel.


```ts
export default buildConfig({
  admin: {
    components: {
      beforeDashboard: ['@/components/BeforeDashboard'],
    },
    importMap: {
      baseDir: path.resolve(dirname),
    },
  // ... rest of your config
});"
 ```
